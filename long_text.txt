To plead my faith where faith hath no reward; To move remorse, where favour is not borne; To plead my faith where faith hath no reward; To move remorse, where favour is not borne; I loved her whom all the world admir'd. I was refus'd of her that can love none: I loved her whom all the world admir'd. I was refus'd of her that can love none: Forget my name, since you have scorn'd my love, And womanlike do not too late lament; Forget my name, since you have scorn'd my love, And womanlike do not too late lament; I was as fond as ever she was fair, Yet lov'd I not more than I now despair. I was as fond as ever she was fair, Yet lov'd I not more than I now despair.  If ever hapless woman had a cause To breathe her plaints into the open air, the open air, And never suffer inward grief to pause Or seek her sorrowshaken soul's repair. Then I, for I have lost my only brother,                       Then I, for I have lost my only brother,                        Who doth behold my mistress' face And seeeth not, good hap hath he. Who hears her speak and marks her  grace, Shall think none ever spake but she. In short for to resound her   praise, She is the fairest, the fairest, the fairest, the fairest of her days.  Of all the birds that I do know, Philip my sparrow hath no peer, For sit she high or sit she low, Be she far off or be she near, there is no bird so fair, so fine, Nor yet so fresh as this of mine,                                                                                                              Whither runneth my     sweet        heart?

Too feeble grief, too weak, too slow despair, Can you, can you, can you want helps to end the pains I bear? Ah me! ah me! while I my Celia's loss bemoan, A thousand, thousand, thousand Deaths, a thousand, thousand, thousand Deaths I die instead of one; Tho' dead to joy, in pain I languish, I languish, languish still; Grief stabs my heart, grief stabs my heart, yet has no pow'r to kill; Grief stabs my heart, grief stabs my heart, yet has no pow'r to kill.  O tum not, turn not those fine eyes away; O turn not, turn not those fine eyes away; Nor blush you gave me, nor blush you gave me that kind look: More than a thousand, a thousand, thousand times me have you took, As I've been stealing, as I've been stealing, stealing of a glimpse or ray: From those two lights which make perpetual, which make perpetual, from those two lights, which make perpetual, perpetual day; From those two lights, which make perpetual, perpetual day: See, fair one, see, see, see, see, fair one, see; see, fair one, see, see, see, see, fair one, see, I'm looking now, I'm looking now another way; You may be kind, you may be kind, and if I must not, if I must not see, I can be blind, blind for that moment you the favour, you the favour show, Then see again, see, see again, to look on only you, then see again, see, see again to look on only you. Come, think no more, no more on this surprise; Come, think no more, no more on this surprise, But let your lover, but let your lover make his court; We've long been at this pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty glancing sport; Now let our tongues, now let our tongues declare, declare, what this implies; 'Tis time we cease, 'tis time we cease the tattle of our eyes; 'tis time we cease, 'tis time we cease the tattle of our eyes.  O Death, O Death, rock me asleep, Bring me to quiet rest; Let pass my weary guiltless ghost Out of my careful breast.

Fancy's twin at birth and death, The color of a damask rose, That fadeth when the north wind blows: Tis such that though all sorts do crave it, They know not what it is to have it: A thing that sometime stoops not to a king, And yet most open to the common'st thing: For she that is most fair, Is open to the air.  O eyes, leave off your weeping; Love hath the   thoughts in keeping That may content you: Let not this misconceiving, Where comforts are receiving, Causless torment you. Let not this misconceiving, Where comforts are receiving, Causless torment you.  Farewell, dear love, since thou wilt needs be gone;  mine eyes do show my life is almost gone.  Nay, I will never die  so long as I can spy.  There be many mo, though that she do go. There be many mo, I fear not; why, then let  her go; I care not. There be many mo, though that she do go.

Because with me, with me once gazing On those, on those fair eyes    where all   pow'rs    have   their being,  where all   pow'rs     have their being. where all pow'rs    have   their being,  where all   pow'rs    have their being.

A painted tale by poets' skill devised, Where words wellplac'd great store of love profess'd, In Love's attire can never mask disguis'd; For looks and sighs true love can best express. And he whose words his passions right can tell Doth more in words, doth more in words than in true love excel. And he whose words his passions right can tell Doth more in words, doth more in words than in true love excel.  Thyrsis and Milla, arm in arm together In merry, merry May to the green garden walked; Where all the way, where all the way they wanton, wanton, wanton riddles talked. The youthful boy kissing her cheeks all rosy, kissing her cheeks all rosy, Beseech'd her there to gather him a posy. The youthful boy kissing her cheeks all rosy, kissing her cheeks all rosy, Beseech'd her there to gather him a posy. She straight her light green silken coats up tucked And may for Mill, and thyme for Thyrsis plucked, Which when she brought he clasp'd her by the middle, And kiss'd her sweet, and kiss'd her sweet, but could not read her riddle. Ah, fool! Ah, fool! With that the nymph set up a laughter And blush'd and ran and ran away, and ran and ran away, and ran and ran away, and ran and ran away; and he ran after, and he ran after, after, and he ran after, after, and he ran after, after.  With my love my life was nestled In the sum of happiness; From my love my life was wrested To a world of heaviness. O let love my life remove, Sith I live not where I love, O let love my life remove, sith I live not where I love.  I saw my lady weeping, And sorrow proud to be advanced so In those fair eyes, in those fair eyes where all perfections kept. Her face was full of woe, But such a woe, believe me, as wins more hearts Than mirth can do, than mirth can do with her enticing parts. But such a woe, believe me, as wins more hearts Than mirth can do, than mirth can do with her enticing parts.  It was a lover and  his lass,                                       That  o'er the green corn fields did pass,                                                                                                                                                                           Who is it that this dark night, who is it that this dark night Under my window plain eth? It is one that from thy sight Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth Ev'ry other vulgar light. It is one that from thy sight Being, ah, exil'd, disdaineth Ev'ry other vulgar light.  Mistress mine, well may you fare; Kind be your thoughts and void of care. Sweet Saint Venus be your speed, That you may in love proceed.                                      Can I forget what Reason's force Imprinted in my heart? Can I unthink these restless thoughts When first I felt Love's dart? Shall tongue recall what Thoughts and Love By Reason once did speak? No, no, all things save death wants force That faithful band to break, no, no, all things save death wants force that faithful band to break.  Love wing'd my hopes, and taught them how to fly Far from base earth, but not to mount, but not to mount, but not to mount too high. For true pleasure, for true pleasure Lives in measure, Which, if men for sake, Blinded they into folly run, blinded they into folly, folly run, and grief, and grief, and grief for pleasure take. For true pleasure, for true pleasure Lives in measure, Which, if men for sake, Blinded they into folly run, blinded they into folly, folly run, and grief, and grief, and grief for pleasure take.  What if my mistress now will needs unconstant be? Wilt thou be then so false in love as well as she? No, no, such falsehood flee, though women faithless be, No, no, such falsehood flee, though women faithless be.  Come, Sorrow, come; sit down and mourn with me; Hang down thy head upon thy baleful breast, That God and man and all the world may see Our heavy hearts do live in quiet rest. Enfold thine arms and wring and wring thy wretched hands, To show the state wherein poor Sorrow stands, to show the state wherein poor Sorrow stands. Enfold thine arms and wring and wring thy wretched hands, To show the state wherein poor Sorrow stands, to show the state wherein poor Sorrow stands.  Fair in a morn (O fairest morn: was ever morn so fair?),  When as the sun, but not the same that shineth in the air,  But of the earth, no earthly sun, and yet no earthly creature, There shone a face, was never face that carried such a feature, there shone a face, was never face that carried such a feature,  Absence, hear  thou my protesta tion Against thy strength,  Distance and length.  Do what you dare,  do what you dare for al tera tion. For hearts of truest metal  Absence doth join,  absence doth join,  and Time doth settle, and Time doth  settle. For hearts of truest metal  Absence doth join,  absence doth join,  and Time doth settle, and Time doth  settle.  Sleep, slumb'ring eyes; give rest unto my cares, My cares, the infants of my troubled brain; My cares, surpris'd, surpris'd with black des pair, Doth the assertion of my hopes restrain. Sleep, then, my eyes, sleep, then, my eyes. O sleep, and take your rest, To banish sorrow, to banish sorrow from a freeborn breast.  How wretched is the state we all are in, That sleep secure in unrepented sin; When not the greatest king on earth can say Tbat he shall live to see the break of day: Nor saints in heav'n, nor blessed angels know, Whether the last and dreadful trump shall blow To judgement of the living and the dead, Before these words I speak are uttered. Oh wake, Oh watch, Oh weep, repent and pray; Oh have in mind that last and bitter day.  Sweet, come again! Your happy sight so much desir'd, Since you from hence are now retir'd, I seek in vain. Still must I mourn And pine in longing pain, Till you my life's de light, again Vouchsafe your wish'd return. Till you my life's de light, again Vouchsafe your wish'd return.  And would you see my mistress' face? It is a flow'ry garden place Where knots of beauties have such grace That all is work and nowhere space, where knots of beauties have such grace That all is work and nowhere space.  No grave for woe, yet earth my wat'ry tears devours; Sighs want air and burnt desires kind pity's show'rs; Stars hold their fatal course, my joys preventing The earth, the sea, the air, the fire, the heav'ns, vow my tormenting. The earth, the sea, the air, the fire, the heav'ns, vow my tormenting.  If I urge my kind desires, She, unkind, doth them reject. Women's hearts are painted fires To deceive them that affect. I alone love's fires include, She alone doth them delude. I alone love's fires include, She alone doth them delude.  What heart's content can he find, What happy sleeps can his eyes embrace, That bears a guilty mind? His taste sweet wines will abhor; No music's sound can appease the thoughts That wicked deeds deplore. The passion of a present fear Still makes his restless motion there, And all the day he dreads the night, And all the night, as one aghast, he fears the morning light, and all the day he dreads the night, And all the night, as one aghast, he fears the morning light.  Let him that will be free and keep his heart from care, Retir'd alone remain, where no discomforts are; For when the eye doth view his grief, or hapless ear his sorrow hears, Th'impression still in him abides, and ever in one shape appears, th'imTh'impression still in him abides, and ever in one shape appears.  Reprove not love, though fondly thou hast lost Greater hopes by loving. Love calms ambitious spirits, from their breasts Danger oft removing. Let lofty humours mount up on high, Down again like to the wind, While private thoughts vow'd to love More peace and pleasure find. While private thoughts vow'd to love More peace and pleasure find.  And would you fain the reason know Why my sad eyes so often flow? My heart ebbs joy when they do so And loves the moon by whom they go, my heart ebbs joy when they do so And loves the moon by whom they go.  When    Laura    smiles, -  -  her sight   re   vives -     both night and day; The  earth and    heaven    views     with   de   light her wanton play; And her     speech with  ev  er flow ing    mus  ic  doth re  pair The    cru  el       wounds of    sor  row and untamed des  pair.  Long have mine eyes gaz'd with delight, Conveying hopes unto my soul, In nothing happy but in sight Of her that doth my sight control. But now mine eyes, but now mine eyes, but now mine eyes must lose their light. But now mine eyes, but now mine eyes, but now mine eyes must lose their light.  Though far from joy, my sorrows are as far, And I both between. Not too low, nor yet too high Above my reach would I be seen. Happy is he that is so placed, Not to be envied, nor to be disdain'd or disgraced. Happy is he that is so placed, Not to be envied, nor to be disdain'd or disgraced.  Shall I come if I swim? Wide are the waves you see. Shall I come if I fly, my dear love, to thee? Streams Venus will appease, Cupid gives me wings; All the pow'rs assist my desire Save you alone, that set my woeful heart on fire. Streams Venus will appease, Cupid gives me wings; All the pow'rs assist my desire Save you alone, that set my woeful heart on fire.  Ay me, that Love, that Love should Nature's works accuse, Where cruel Laura still her beauty views; River, or cloudy jet, or crystal bright, Are all but servants of her selfdelight. Are all but servants of her selfdelight.  Shall, then, a traittorous kiss or a smile All my delights unhappily beguile? Shall the vow of feigned love receive so rich reward, When true service dies neglected and wants his due reward? When true service dies neglected and wants his due reward? When ward?  If I hope, I pine; if I fear, I faint and die; So between hope and fear I desp'rate lie, Looking for joy to heav'n whence it should come; But hope is blind, joy deaf, and I am dumb. Looking for joy to heav'n whence it should come; But hope is blind, joy deaf, and I am dumb.  Unless there were consent 'twixt hell and heav'n That grace and wickedness should be combin'd, I cannot make thee and thy beauties even, Thy  face is heaven, and torture in thy mind. For  more than worldly bliss is in thy eye, And hellish torture in thy mind doth lie. For  more than worldly bliss is in thy eye, And hellish torture in thy mind doth lie.  If she forsake me, I must die; Shall I tell her so? Alas, then straight will she reply: No, no, no, no, no. If I disclose my desp'rate state, She will but make sport thereat, And more unrelenting grow. If I disclose my desp'rate state, She will but make sport thereat, And more unrelenting grow.  What is a day, what is a year of vain delight and pleasure? Like to a dream, it endless dies, And from us like a vapour flies; And this is all the fruit that we find which glory in worldly treasure. And this is all the fruit that we find which glory in worldly treasure.  Kind in unkindness, when will you relent And cease with faint love true love to torment? Still entertain'd, excluded still I stand, Her glove still hold, but cannot touch the hand. Still entertain'd, excluded still I stand, Her glove still hold, but cannot touch the hand.  What, then, is love but mourning? What desire but a selfburning? Till she that hates doth love return, Thus will I mourn, Thus will I sing:          Thus will I mourn, Thus will I sing:           Whether men do laugh or weep, Whether they do wake or sleep, Whether they die young or old, Whether they feel heat or cold, There is underneath the sun Nothing in true earnest done. There is underneath the sun Nothing in true earnest done.  In a grove most rich of shade, Where birds wanton music made, May then young his pied weeds showing, New perfum'd with flow'rs fresh growing. May, then young, his pied weeds showing, New perfum'd with flow'rs fresh growing.  Adieu, adieu, adieu,    sweet Amarillis, adieu,      sweet     Amarillis, adieu, adieu, adieu. sweet Amarillis: For   since to part, to part your will is, Adieu, adieu, adieu,    sweet Amarillis, adieu,      sweet     Amarillis, adieu, adieu, adieu. sweet Amarillis: For   since to part, to part your will is, O heavy tiding, Here is for me no biding: Yet once again, yet once again, again, ere that I part with you, yet once again, yet once again, again, ere that I part with you, Amarillis, Amarillis, sweet adieu, adieu, adieu, A-  dieu,    sweet Amarillis, Amarillis, sweet adieu.  I prithee turn that face a way, whose splendor but benights the day; sad eyes like mine, and wounded hearts, shun the bright rays which beauty darts; Un welcome is the sun that pries into those shades where sorrow lies: Go shine on happy things; to me, that blessing is a miserie; whom thy fierce sun not warms but burns, like that the sooty Indian turns; I'll serve the night, and there confin'd; with thee less fair or else more kind.  In a season all oppresed, With sad sorrows poor distressed, Troilus said unto his Cressid: Yield, O yield thee sweet and stay not: O no no no no no no no no, Sweet Love, I may not.  Take,  o take those lips      away, That so sweetly were forsworn, And those eyes the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn; But my kisses bring again; Seals of love, but seal'd in vain. Take,  o take those lips      away, That so sweetly were forsworn, And those eyes the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn; But my kisses bring again; Seals of love, but seal'd in vain.  Author of light, revive my dying spright; Redeem it from the snares of allconfounding night. Lord, light me to thy blessed way: For blind, for blind with worldly vain desires, I wander as a stray. Sun and moon, stars and under  lights I see, But all their glorious beams are mists and darkness, being compar'd to Thee.  The man of life upright, Whose cheerful mind is free From weight of impious deeds, And yoke of vanity.  Where are all the beauties now all hearts enchain ing?

Bravely deck'd come forth bright day, Thine hours with roses strew thy way, As they well remember. Thou receiv'd shalt be with feasts, Come chiefest of the Briish guests, Thou fifth of November. Thou with triumph shalt exceed In the strictest ember; For by thy return the Lord records His blessed deed.  To music bent is my retired mind, and fain would I some song of pleasure sing: But in vain joys no comfort now I find, From heav'nly thoughts all true delights doth spring. Thy pow'r, O God, Thy mercies to record. Will sweeten ev'ry note and ev'ry word. Thy pow'r, O God, Thy mercies to record. Will sweeten ev'ry note and ev'ry word.  Tune thy music to thy heart, Sing thy joy with thanks and so thy sorrow: Though devotion needs not art, Sometime of the poor the rich may borrow.  Most sweet and pleasing are thy ways, O God, Like meadows deck'd with crystal streams and flow'rs: Thy paths no foot profane hath ever trod, Nor hath the proud man rested in thy bow'rs. There lives no vulture, no devouring bear, But only doves and lambs are harbour'd there. There lives no vulture, no devouring bear, But only doves and lambs are harbour'd there.  Wise men patience never want; Good men pity cannot hide: Feeble spirits only vaunt Of revenge, the poorest pride. He alone forgive that can Bears the true soul of a man. He alone forgive that can Bears the true soul of a man.  Never weather beaten sail more willing bent to   shore, Never tired Pilgrims limbs affected slumber  more; Then my weary    spright now longs to fly out of my   troubled breast. O come quickly, O come quickly, O come quickly    sweetest Lord, and take my soul to rest. O come quickly, O come quickly, O come quickly    sweetest Lord, and take my soul to rest.  Never weatherbeaten sail more willing bent to shore, Never tired pilgrim's limbs affected slumber more; Than my weary sprite now longs to fly out of my troubled breast. O come quickly, O come quickly, O come quickly, sweetest Lord, and take my soul to rest. O come quickly, O come quickly, O come quickly, sweetest Lord, and take my soul to rest.  Lift up to heav'n, sad wretch, thy heavy sprite, What though thy sins thy due destruction threat? The Lord exceeds in mercy as in might; His ruth is greater, though thy crimes be great. Repentance needs not fear the heav'ns just rod, It stays ev'n thunder in the hand of God. Repentance needs not fear the heav'ns just rod, It stays ev'n thunder in the hand of God.  Lo, when back mine eye, Pilgrimlike, I cast, What fearful ways I spy, Which, blinded, I securely pass'd?  As by the streams of Babylon, Far from our native soil we sat, Sweet Sion, thee we thought upon, And ev'ry thought a tear begat. Sweet Sion, thee we thought upon, And ev'ry thought a tear begat.  Sing a song of joy; Praise our God with mirth: His flock who can destroy? Is He not Lord of heav'n and earth?  Awake, awake, thou heavy sprite, That sleep'st the deadly sleep of sin; Rise now and walk the ways of light: 'Tis not too late yet to begin. Seek heaven early, seek it late: True faith still finds an open gate. Seek heaven early, seek it late: True faith still finds an open gate.  Come, cheerful day, come cheerful day, part of my life to me: For while thou view'st me with thy fading light, Part of my life doth still depart with thee, And I still onward haste to my last night. Time's fatal wings do ever forward fly, So ev'ry day, so ev'ry day we live, we live, a day we die. Time's fatal wings do ever forward fly, So ev'ry day, so ev'ry day we live, we live, a day we die.  Seek the Lord, and in His ways persever: O faint not. but as eagles fly, For his steep hill is high, Then striving gain the top and triumph ever. O faint not. but as eagles fly, For his steep hill is high, Then striving gain the top and triumph ever.  Lighten heavy heart, thy sprite, The joys recall that thence are fled: Yield thy breast some living light, The man that nothing doth is dead. Tune thy temper to these sounds, And quicken so thy joyless mind; Sloth the worst and best confounds, It is the ruin of mankind.  Jack and Joan they think no ill, But loving live, and merry still; Do their weekdays' work, and pray Devoutly on the holly day; Skip and trip it on the green, And help to choose the Summer Queen; Lash out at a country feast Their silver penny with the best.  All looks be pale, hearts cold as stone, For Hally now is dead and gone, Hally in whose sight, Most sweet sight, All the earth late took delight. Ev'ry eye weep with me, weep with me, weep with me, Joys drown'd in tears must be, joys drown'd in tears must be.  Vain men whose follies make a god of love, Whose blindness beauty doth immortal deem, Praise not what you desire, but what you prove; Count those things good that are, not those that seem. I cannot call her true that's false to me, Nor make of women more than women be. I cannot call her true that's false to me, Nor make of women more than women be.  How eas'ly wert thou chained, Fond heart by favours feigned? Why liv'd thy hopes in grace, Straight to die, straight to die disdained? But since th'art now beguiled, By love that falsely smiled, In some less happy place Mourn alone, mourn alone exiled. My love still here increaseth, And with my love my grief, While her sweet bounty ceaseth, That gave my woes relief. Yet 'tis no woman leave me, For such may prove unjust, A goddess thus deceives me, Whose faith who could mistrust.  How eas'ly wert thou chained, Fond heart by favours feigned?

Yet 'tis no woman leave me, For such may prove unjust, A goddess thus deceives me, Whose faith who could mistrust.  Harden now thy tired heart, with more then flinty rage; N'er let her false tears henceforth thy constant grief assuage. Once true happy days thou saw'st, when she stood firm and kind: Both as one then liv'd and held one ear, one  tongue,  one mind. But now those bright hours be fled, and never may return: What then remains but her untruths to mourn? But now those bright hours be fled, and never may return: What then remains but her untruths to mourn?  O, what unhop'd for sweet supply, O, what joys ex ceeding! What an affecting charm feel I From delight proceeding? That which I long despair'd to be. To her I am, to her I am, and she, and she to me. That which I long despair'd to be. To her I am, to her I am, and she, and she to me.  Where she her sacred bow'r adorns, The rivers clearly flow: The groves and meadows swell with flow'rs, The winds all gently blow. Her sunlike beauty shines so fair Her Spring can never fade: Who then can blame the life that strives To harbour in her shade?  Fain would I my love disclose, Ask what  honour might deny; But both love and her I lose, From my motion if she fly. Worse than pain is fear to me, Then hold in fancy, though it burn; If not happy, safe I'll be, And to my cloister'd cares return.  Give beauty all her right; She's not to one form tied: Each shape yields fair delight Where her perfections bide. Helen, I grant, might pleasing be, And Ros'mond, and Ros'mond was as sweet, was as sweet, was as sweet as she. Helen, I grant, might pleasing be, And Ros'mond, and Ros'mond was as sweet, was as sweet, was as sweet as she.  O, dear, that I with thee might live, From human trace removed: Where jealous care might neither grieve, Yet each dote on their loved: While fond fear may colour find, Love's seldom pleased: But much like a sick man's rest, it's soon diseased. While fond fear may colour find, Love's seldom pleased: But much like a sick man's rest, it's soon diseased.  Good men show, if you can tell, Where doth human pity dwell? Far and near her would I seek, So vex'd with sorrow is my breast. She (they say) to all is meek; And only makes th'unhappy bless'd.  What harvest half so sweet is, As still to reap the kisses Grown ripe in sowing? And straight to be receiver Of that which thou art giver, Rich in bestowing? Kiss then my harvest queen, Full garners heaping; Kisses ripest when th'are green, Want only reaping. Kissthen my harvest queen, Full garners heaping; Kisses ripest when th'are green, Want only reaping.  Sweet, exclude me not, nor be divided From him that ere long must bed thee: All thy maiden doubts law hath decided, Sure we are, and I must wed thee. Presume then yet a little more, yet a little more, yet a little more, yet a little more, Here's the way, the way, the way; bar not the door. Presume then yet a little more, yet a little more, yet a little more, yet a little more, Here's the way, the way, the way; bar not the door.  The peaceful  western wind The winter storms hath tam'd, And nature in each kind the kind heat hath in flam'd. The forward buds so sweetly breathe Out of their earthly bow'rs, That heav'n which views their pomp beneath, Would fain be deck'd with flow'rs. The forward buds so sweetly breathe Out of their earthly bow'rs, That heav'n which views their pomp beneath, Would fain be deck'd with flow'rs.  There is none, O none but you, That from me estrange your sight, Whom mine eyes affect to view, Or chained ears hear with delight.  Pin'd I am and like to die, And all for lack of that which I Do ev'ry day refuse: If I musing sit or stand, Some puts it daily in my hand, To interrupt my muse. The same thing I seek and fly. And want that which none would deny. The same thing I seek and fly. And want that which none would deny.  So many loves have I neglected, Whose good parts might move me: That now I live of all reject ed, There is none will love me. Why is maiden heat so coy? It freezeth when it burneth; Loseth what it might enjoy, And, having lost it, mourneth.  Though your strangeness frets my heart, Yet may I not complain: You persuade me, 'tis but art That secret love must feign. If another you affect, 'Tis but a show t'avoid suspect, Is this fair excusing? O no, all is abusing. If another you affect, 'Tis but a show t'avoid suspect, Is this fair excusing? O no, all is abusing.  Come away, come away, arm'd with love's delights Thy sprightful graces bring with thee, When love and longing fights, They must  the sticklers be. Come quickly, come, the promis'd hour is wellnigh spent, And pleasure being too much deferr'd, loseth her best content. Come quickly, come, the promis'd hour is wellnigh spent, And pleasure being too much deferr'd, loseth her best content.  Come, you pretty, falseeyed wanton, Leave your crafty smiling: Think you to escape me now, With slipp'ry words beguiling? No, you mock'd me th'other day; When you got loose, you fled away: But since I have caught you now, I'll clip your wings for flying: Smoth'ring kisses fast I'll heap And keep you so from crying.  A secret love or two I must confess I kind ly welcome for change in close playing: Yet my dear husband I love   ne'er   theless, His desires, whole or half, quickly allaying, At all times ready to offer redress. His own he never wants but hath it duly, Yet twits me I keep not touch with him truly. His own he never wants but hath it duly, Yet twits me I keep not touch with him truly.  Her rosy cheeks, her ever smiling eyes, Are spheres and beds where love in triumph lies: Her rubine lips when they their pearl unlock, Make them seem as they did rise All out of one smooth coral rock. O, that of other creatures' store I knew, More worthy and more rare, For these are old and she so new, That her to them none should compare. O, that of other creatures' store I knew, More worthy and more rare, For these are old and she so new, That her to them none should compare.  Where shall I refuge seek, where shall I refuge seek if you refuse me? In you my hope, in you my fortune lies: In you my life, in you my life, Though you, unjust, accuse me, My service  scorn and merit underprize. O bitter grief, O bitter grief, that exile is become Reward for faith, and pity deaf and dumb. O bitter grief, O bitter grief, that exile is become Reward for faith, and pity deaf and dumb.  Oft have I sigh'd, oft have I sigh'd oft have I sigh'd for him that hears me not Who, absent, hath both love and me forgot. O yet I languish still, yet I languish still, yet I languish still through his delay. Days seem as years when wished friends break their day. O yet I languish still, yet I languish still, yet I languish still through his delay. Days seem as years when wished friends break their day.  Now let her change and spare not. Since she proves strange, I care not. Feigned love charm'd so my delight, That still I doted on her sight. But she is gone, new joys embracing, And my desires disgracing. But she is gone, new joys embracing, And my desires disgracing.  Were my heart as some men's are, Thy errors would not move me; But thy faults I curious find, And speak because I love thee. Patience is a thing divine, And far, I grant, above me.  Maids are simple, some men say. They forsooth will trust no men. But should they men's wills obey, Maids were very simple then.  So tired are all my thoughts That sense and spirits fail. Mourning I pine, and know not what I ail. O what can yield ease to a mind, Joy in nothing that can find?  Why presumes thy pride on that that must so private be? Scarce that it can good be called, though it seems best to thee, Best of all that Nature framed, or curious eye can see?  Kind are her answers, But her performance keeps no day; Breaks time as dancers From their own music when they stray. All her free favours And smooth words wing my hopes in vain. O did ever voice so sweet but only feign? Can true love yield such delay, Converting joy to pain?  O grief, O spite, to see poor Virtue scorned, Truth far exil'd, false Art lov'd, Vice  a dored, Free Justice sold, worst causes best adorned, Right cast by Power, Pity in vain implored. O who in such an age could wish to live, When none can have or hold but such as give?  O never to be moved, O beauty unrelenting! Hard heart, too dearly loved, Fond love, too late repenting! Why did I dream of too  much bliss? Deceitful hope was cause  of this. O hear, O hear, O hear me speak, O hear me speak this and no more; this and no more, this and no more: Live you in joy, while I my woes, my woes deplore.  Break now, my heart, and die. O no, O no, she may relent. Let my despair prevail. O stay, O stay, hope is not spent. Should she now fix one smile on thee, where were despair? The loss is but easy which smiles can repair; A stranger would please thee if she were as fair.  If Love loves Truth, then women do not love. Their passions all are but dissembled shows: Now kind and free of favour if they prove, Their kindness straight their tempest overthrows. Then as a seaman the poor lover fares; The storm drowns him ere he can drown his cares.  Now winter nights en large The number  of their hours, And  clouds their  storms discharge Upon  the airy towers. Let  now the chimneys blaze, And cups o'erflow with wine. Let welltuned ords amaze With har mony divine. Now yellow waxen lights Shall wait on honey love, While youthful revels, masks, and courtly sights Sleep's leaden spells remove.  Awake, thou spring of speaking grace, mute rest becomes not thee. The fairest women, while they sleep, and pictures, equal be. O come and dwell in love's discourses, Old re newing, new creating. The words which thy rich tongue discourses Are not of the common rating.  What is it all that men possess, among themselves conversing? Wealth or Fame or some such boast scarce worthy the rehearsing. Women only are men's good, with them in love conversing.  Fire that must flame is with apt fuel fed. Flowers that will thrive in sunny sail are bred. How can a heart feel heat that no hope finds? Or can he love on whom no  comfort shines?  If thou long'st so much to learn, sweet boy, what 'tis to love, Do but fix thy thought on me, and thou shalt quickly prove. Little suit at first shall win Way to thy abashed desire; But then will I hedge thee in, Salamanderlike, with fire.  Shall I come, sweet love, to thee When the evening beams are set? Shall I not excluded be? Will you find no feigned let? Let me not, for pi ty, more Tell the long. long hours, tell the long hours at your door. Let me Shall I come, sweet love, to thee When the evening beams are set? Shall I not excluded be? Will you find no feigned let? Let me not, for pi ty, more Tell the long. long hours, tell the long hours at your door.  Thrice  toss these oaken ashes in the air. Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chair. Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot, And murmur soft: She will, or she will not. Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot, And murmur soft: She will, or she will not.  Thrice  toss these oaken ashes in the air. Thrice sit thou mute in this enchanted chair. Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot, And murmur soft: She will, or she will not. Then thrice three times tie up this true love's knot, And murmur soft: She will, or she will not. Go  Be thou then my beauty named, Since thy will is to be mine. For by that am I inflamed, Which on all alike doth shine. Others may the light admire; I only truly feel the fire. Others may the light admire; I only truly feel the fire.  Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Lo, here I burn, I burn in such desire, That all the tears that I can strain Out of mine idle empty brain Cannot allay my scorching pain. Come, Trent and Humber and fair Thames, Dread Ocean, haste with all   thy streams, And if you cannot quench my fre, O drown both me, O drown both me and my desire. O drown both me, O drown both me and my desire.  O sweet delight, O more than human bliss, With her to live that ever loving is! To hear her speak whose words so well are placed, That she by them, as they in her, are graced; Those looks to view that feast the viewer's eye, How blest is he that may so live and die!  Thus I resolve, and time hath taught me so, Since she is fair and ever kind to me. Though she be wild and wantonlike in show, Those little stains in youth I will not see. That she be constant, heav'n I oft im plore. If prayers prevail not, I can do no more.  Come, O come, my life's de light, Let me not in languor pine. Love loves  no delay; thy sight The more enjoyed the more divine. O come, and take from me The pain of being depriv'd of thee. O come, and take from me The pain of being depriv'd of thee.  Could my heart more tongues employ Than it harbours thoughts of grief; It is now so far from joy That it scarce could ask relief. Truest hearts  by deeds unkind To despair are most inclined. Truest hearts  by deeds unkind To despair are most inclined.  Sleep, angry Beauty, sleep, and fear not me. For who a sleeping lion dares provoke? It shall suffice me here to sit and see Those lips shut up that never kindly spoke. What sight can more content a lover's mind Than  beau ty seeming harmless, if not kind?  Silly boy, 'tis full moon yet, thy night as day shines clearly. Had thy youth but wit to fear, thou could'st not love so dearly. Shortly wilt thou mourn when all thy pleasures are bereaved; Little  knows he how to love that never was deceived.  Never love unless you can Bear with all the faults of man. Men sometimes will jealous be, Though but little cause they see, And hang the head as discontent, And speak what straight they will repent.  So quick  so hot, so mad is thy fond suit, So rude, so tedious grown in urging me. That fain I would with loss make thy tongue mute, And yield some little grace to quiet thee. An hour with thee I care not to converse, For I would not be counted too perverse. An hour with thee I care not to converse, For I would not be counted too perverse.  Shall I then hope when faith is fled? Can I seek love when hope is gone? Or can I live when love is dead? Poorly he lives that can love none. Her vows are broke, and I am free, She lost her faith in losing me.  Leave prolonging, leave prolong ing thy distress; All delays afflict the dying. Many lost sighs  long I spent, To her for mercy crying. But now, vain mourning, cease; I'll die, I'll die, and mine own griefs release. But now, vain mourning, cease; I'll die, I'll die, and mine own griefs release.  Respect my faith, regard my service past; The hope you wing'd, call home to you at last. Great prize it is that I in you shall gain, So great for you hath been my loss and pain. My  wits I spent, and time, for you alone, Observing you and losing all for one. My wits I spent, and time, for you alone, Observing you and losing all for one.  Thou joy'st, fond boy, to be by many loved, To have thy beauty of most dames approved. For this thou dost  thy native worth disguise, And play'st the sycophant t'observe  their eyes. Thy glass thou counsel'st more t'adorn thy skin, That first should school thee to be fair within.  Veil, Love, mine eyes. O hide from me The plagues that charge the curious mind. If beauty private will not be, Suffice it yet that she proves kind. Who can usurp heav'n's light alone? Stars were not made, stars were not made to shine on one. Who can usurp heav'n's light alone? Stars were not made, stars were not made to shine on one.  Ev'ry dame affects good fame, whate'er her doings be; But true praise is Virtue's  bays, which. none may wear but she. Borrowed guise fits not the wise; a simple look is best; Native grace becomes a face, though ne'er so rudely dress'd. Now such newfound toys are sold these women to disguise, That before the year grows old the newest fashion dies. Now such newfound toys are sold these women to disguise, That before the year grows old the newest fashion dies.  So sweet so sweet is thy discourse to me, And so delightful is thy sight, As I taste nothing right but thee. O why invented Nature light? Was it alone for beau ty's sake, That her graced words might better take? O why invented Nature light? Was it alone for beau ty's sake, That her graced words might better take?  There is a garden in her face, Where roses and white lilies grow; A heav'nly paradise is  that place, Wherein all pleasant fruits do grow. There cherries hang which none may buy,                             To his sweet lute Apollo sung the motions of the spheres, The wondrous order of the stars whose course divides the years, And all the mysteries above. But none of this could Midas move, Which purchased him his ass's ears.  Young and simple though I am, I have heard of Cupid's name. Guess I can what thing it is, Men desire  when they do kiss. Smoke can never burn, they say, But the flames that follow may. Smoke can never burn, they say, But the flames that follow may.  Love me or not, love her I must, or die. Leave me or not, follow her needs must I. O that her grace would my wish'd comforts give! How  rich in her, how happy should I live. O that her grace would my wish'd comforts give! How  rich in her, how happy should I live.  What means this folly now  to brave it so, And then to use submission? Is that a friend that straight can play the foe? Who loves on such condition? Is that a friend that straight can play the foe? Who loves on such condition?  Dear, if I with guile would gild a true intent, Heaping flatt'ries that in heart were never meant, Eas'ly could I then obtain What now in vain I force; Falsehood much doth gain, Truth yet holds the better course. Falsehood much doth gain, Truth yet holds the better course.  O Love, where are thy shafts, thy quiver and thy bow? Shall my wounds only weep, and he ungaged go? Be just and strike him  too that dares contemn thee so.  Beauty is but a painted hell. Ay me! Ay me! She wounds them that admire it; She kills them that desire it. Give her pride but fuel, No fire  is more cruel. Give her pride but fuel, No fire  is more cruel.  Are you what your fair looks express? O then be kind! From law of nature they digress, Whose form suits not their mind. Fairness seen in th'outward shape Is but the inward beauty's ape. Fairness seen in th'outward shape Is but the inward beauty's ape.  Since she, e'en she for whom I lived, Sweet she, by fate from me is torn, Why am not I of sense depriv'd, Forgetting I was ever born? Why should I languish,  hating light? Better to sleep an endless night. Why should I languish,  hating light? Better to sleep an endless night.  I must complain, yet do enjoy my love. She is too fair, too rich in lovely parts. Thence is my grief; for Nature, while she strove With all her graces and divinest arts To form her too too beautiful of hue, She had no leisure left to make her true. To form her too too beautiful of hue, She had no leisure left to make her true.  Think'st thou to seduce me then with words that have no meaning? Parrots so  can learn to prate, our speech  by pieces gleaning. Nurses teachtheir children so about the time of weaning.  Her fair inflaming eyes, Chief authors of my cares, I prayed in humblest wise With grace to  view my tears. They beheld me broad awake, But, alas, no ruth would take.  Turn all thy thoughts to eyes; Turn all thy hairs to ears; Change all thy friends to spies, And all thy joys to fears; True love will yet be free In spite of jealoussy. True love will yet be free In spite of jealoussy.  If any hath the heart to kill, Come rid me of this woeful pain. For while I live I suffer still This cruel torment all in vain. Yet none alive but one can guess What is the cause of my distress. Yet none alive but one can guess What is the cause of my distress.  Beauty, since you so much desire To know the place of Cupid's fire, About you somewhere doth it rest, Yet never harboured in your breast, Nor  goatlike in your heel or toe. What fool would seek Love's flame so low? But a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher, There, there, O there lies Cupid's fire.  Your fair looks urge my desire. Calm it, sweet, with love. Stay, O why will you retire? Can you churlish prove? If love may persuade, Love's pleasures, dear, deny not. Here is a grove secured with shade. O then be wise and fly not. If love may persuade, Love's pleasures, dear, deny not. Here is a grove secured with shade. O then be wise and fly not.  Fain would I wed a fair  young man, that day and night could please me, When my mind or body grieved that had the power to ease me. Maids are full of long ing thoughts that breed a bloodless sickness; and that, oft I hear men say, is only cured by quickness. Oft I have been wooed and prayed but never could be moved. Many for a day or so I have most dearly loved. But this foolish mind of mine straight loathes the thing resolved. If to love be sin in me, that sin is soon absolved. Sure, I think I shall at last fly to some holy Order; When I once am settled there, then I can fly no farther. Yet I would not die a maid, because I had a mother; As I was by one brought forth, I would bring forth another.  Now hath Flora robb'd her bow'rs To befriend this place with flow'rs; strowe aboute, strowe aboute, the sky rain'd never kindlier showers.   Flow'rs with Bridals well agree, Fresh as brides and bridegrooms be, strowe aboute strowe aboute, and mix them with fit melodie. Earth hath not princelier flow'rs than roses white and roses red, but they must still be mingeled. And as a rose new pluckt from Venus' thorn, so doth a bride her bridegroom's bed adorn. And as a rose new pluckt from Venus' thorn, so doth a bride her bridegroom's bed adorn.  Move now with measur'd sound, you charming grove of gold; trace forth the sacred ground that shall your forms unfold. Diana and the starry night for your Apollo's sake Endue your silvan shapes with pow'r, this strange delight to make. Much joy must needs the place betide where trees for gladness move. A fairer sight was ne'er beheld, or more expressing love.  Shows and nightly revels, signs of joy and peace, fill royal Britain's court, while cruel warfare off doth rage, for ever hence exiled. Shows and nightly revels, signs of joy and peace, fill royal Britain's court, while cruel warfare off doth rage, for ever hence exiled. Fair and princely branches with strong arms increase from that deeprooted tree whose sacred strength and glory foreign malice hath beguiled. Our divided kingdoms now in friendly kindred meet, and old debate to love and kindness turns our pow'r with double force uniting. Our divided kingdoms now in friendly kindred meet, and old debate to love and kindness turns our pow'r with double force uniting. Truly reconciled grief appears at last more sweet both to our selves and faithful friends our undermining foes affrighting.  Triumph now with joy and mirth the God of peace hath blest our land: Triumph now with joy and mirth the God of peace hath blest our land: We through his most loving grace a king and king ly seed behold, We through his most loving grace a king and king ly seed behold, Triumph, then, and yield him praise, that gives us blest and joyful days. Triumph, then, and yield him praise, that gives us blest and joyful days.  Time, that leads the fatal round, hath made his center in our ground, with swelling seas embraced.

Their Cupids there do dance and Venus sweetly sings with heav'nly notes tun'd to sound of     My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love. And though the sager sort our deeds reprove, Let us not weigh them. Heav'n's great lamps do dive Into their west, and straight again revive. But soon as once set is our little light, Then must we sleep one everduring night, everduring night. But soon as once set is our little light, Then must we sleep one everduring night, everduring night.  Though you are young and I am old, Though your veins hot and my blood cold, Though youth is moist and age is dry, Yet embers live when flames do die. Though youth is moist and age is dry, Yet embers live when flames do die.  I care not for these ladies that must be woo'd and   pray'd; Give me kind Amarillis, the wanton country maid. Nature art disdaineth; her beauty is her own. Her                           Her                            Follow thy fair sun, unhappy shadow. Though thou, though thou be black as night, And she made all of light, Yet follow thy fair sun, unhappy  shadow. Though thou, though thou be black as night, And she made all of light, Yet follow thy fair sun, unhappy  shadow.  My love hath vowed he  will for sake me, And I am already sped. Far other promise he did make me, When he had my maiden head. If such danger be in playing, And sport must to earnest turn, I will go no more amaying. If such danger be in playing, And sport must to earnest turn, I will go no more amaying.  When to her lute Corinna sings, Her voice revives the leaden strings, And doth in highest     notes appear As any challeng'd echo clear. But when she doth of      mourning speak, E'en    with her sighs her sighs her sighs the strings do      break, the      strings do break.

Turn back, you wanton flyer, And answer my desire With mutual greeting. Yet bend a little nearer, True beauty shines still clearer in closer meeting. Hearts with hearts delighted Should strive to be united, Either other's arms with arms enchaining. Hearts with a thought, Rosy lips with a kiss Still entertaining. Hearts with a thought, Rosy lips with a kiss Still entertaining.  It fell on a    summer's day     While sweet Bessy      sleeping lay In her bower    on her bed,  Light with cur   tains shadowed, Jamie came. She him spies, Op'ning half her heavy    eyes.

The weaker cares by sleep are conquered, But I alone with hideous grief aghast, In spite of Morpheus' charms, a watch do keep Over mine eyes to banish careless sleep. In spite of Morpheus' charms, a watch do keep Over mine eyes to banish careless sleep.  Follow your Saint, follow with accents      sweet;    Haste you, sad notes, fall at her flying feet.    There      wrapped in cloud of sorrow, pity    move, And tell the ravisher of my soul I perish for her   love. But if she   scorns    my never ceasing pain, Then   burst    with   sighing in her  sight and ne'er return a  gain.  Fair, if you expect admiring, Sweet, if you provoke desiring, Grace dear love with kind requit ing. Fond, but if thy sight be blindness, False, if thou affect unkindness, Fly both love and love's delight ing. Then when hope is lost and love is scorned, I'll bury my desires And quench the fires That ever yet in vain have burned. I'll bury my desires And quench the fires That ever yet in vain have burned.  Thou art not fair for all thy red and white, For all those rosy ornaments in thee. Thou art not sweet, though made of mere delight, Nor fair nor sweet, unless thou pity me. I will not soothe thy fancies. Thou shalt prove That beauty is no beauty without love. I will not soothe thy fancies. Thou shalt prove That beauty is no beauty without love.  See where she flies enraged from me. View her when she intends despite. The wind is not more swift than she. Her fury mov'd such terror makes As, to a fearful guilty sprite, The voice of heav'n' huge thunder cracks. But when her appeased mind Yields to delight, All her thoughts are made of joys, Millions of delights inventing, Other pleasures are but toys To her beauty's sweet contenting.  Blame not my cheeks, though pale with love they be; The kindly heat unto my heart is flown To cherish it that is dismay'd by thee, Who art so cruel and unsteadfast grown. For Nature, called for  by distressed hearts, Neglects and quite for sakes the outward parts. For Nature, called for  by distressed hearts, Neglects and quite for sakes the outward parts.  When the merry god of love As yet in his cradle lay, Thus his wither'd nurse did say: Thou a wanton boy will prove, To deceive the pow'rs above; For by thy continual smi -ling I see thy pow'r of beguilling. For by thy continual smi -ling I see thy pow'r of beguilling.  Mistress, since you so much desire To know the place of Cupid's fire, In your fair shrine that flame doth rest, Yet never harbour'd in your breast. It bides not in your lips so sweet Nor where the rose and lilies meet, But a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher, There, there, O there, lies Cupid's fire. But a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher, but a little higher, There, there, O there, lies fire.  Your fair looks inflame my desire. Quench it again with love. Stay, O strive not still to retire; Do not inhuman prove. If love may persuade, Love's pleasures, dear, deny not. Here is a silent grovy shade; O tarry then, and fly not.

Hark, all you ladies that do sleep, The fairy queen Proserpina Bids you awake and pity them that weep. You may do in the dark What the day doth forbid. Fear not the dogs that bark; Night will have all hid. You may do in the dark What the day doth forbid. Fear not the dogs that bark; Night will have all hid.  When thou must home to shades of underground, And there arrived, a new admired guest, The beauteous spirits do ingirt thee round, White Iope, blythe Helen and the rest, To hear the stories of thy finished love From that smooth tongue, whose music hell can move. To hear the stories of thy finished love From that smooth tongue, whose music hell can move.  Come, let us sound with melody the praises Of the kings' King, th'omnipotent Creator, Author of number that hath all the world in Harmony framed.  Sink  down,  proud thoughts; your mounting hopes must now descend. Come, grief and care; hence, joys, your triumph now must end. Heav'ns now will smile no more; my light is shaded. I pine without redress; my life, my spirits like flow'rs are faded. Heav'ns now will smile no more; my light is shaded. I pine without redress; my life, my spirits like flow'rs are faded.  Some can flatter, some can feign; simple truth shall plead for me. Let not beauty truth disdain; truth is e'en as fair as she. Let not beauty truth disdain; truth is e'en as fair as she.  Sweet, restrain these show'rs of kindness from distrust proceeding. Nurse not wrong conceived blindness by too much sigh breeding. Love by error seems astray, but dies if once suspected. Women most believe when they most by men are neglected.  If streams of tears could lessen extreme grief, or cause a minute's truce to woe; if deepest sighs, sad plaints might yield relief, these sorrows to forgo, mine eyes, my heart, my tongue should near refrain to weep, to sigh, and to complain. But sorrow such impression left, of sight. of speech it me bereft, only to sigh, only to sigh, only to sigh, to sigh, to sigh, is left to me, in this my greatest misery.  Sweet, sweet, sweet, let me go, sweet, sweet, sweet sweet, let me go, let me go. What do you mean to vex me so, what do you mean to vex me so? Cease, cease, cease your pleading force do you think thus to extort remorse? Now, now, now, now now no more, no more, no more. alas, you overbear me, and I would cry, and I would cry, and I would cry, and I would cry, but some would   hear, I fear me. Now, now, now, now now no more, no more, no more. alas, you overbear me, and I would cry, and I would cry, and I would cry, and I would cry, but some would   hear, I fear me.  He that hath no mistress must not wear a favor; he that woos a mistress must serve before he have her. He that hath no bedfellow must lie alone, and he that hath no lady must be content with none. And so must I, for why, alas, my love and I am parted, my love and I am parted. False Cupid, I will have thee whip'd and have thy mother carted. And so must I, for why, alas, my love and I am parted, my love and I am parted. False Cupid, I will have thee whip'd and have thy mother carted.  Sweet Cupid, ripen her desire; thy joyful harvest may begin. If age approach a little nigher, 'twil be too late, 'twill be too late, 'twill be too late to get it in, if age approach a little nigher, 'twil be too late, 'twill be too late, 'twill be too late to get it in.  Vain is all this world's contention, fortunes frail, and hopes deceiving. Chance lays ambush of prevention, our attemps of end bereaving/ Future things are plac'd beyond our weak conceiving minds in ev'ry age new; thoughts engender 'till all to fate we render. Future things are plac'd beyond our weak conceiving minds in ev'ry age new; thoughts engender 'till all to fate we render.  Beauty sat bathing by a spring, where fairest shades did hide her. The winds blew calm, the birds did sing the cool streams ran beside her. My wanton thoughts intic'd mine eye to see what was forbidden, but better memory said fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, fie, so vain desire was chidden, so vain desire was chidden.  Now would 'chwore hong'd, zis, but thou most ma wrong. God's bors, I crie God mercy to zweare. Hast not my rings and things and geare with vaith and troth among, and wout vorzake ma now, and wout vorzake ma now? Nay, masse, ware that, nay, masse, ware that vor if thou doo, 'chill take a knife and honge my zelfe vor one of thow. Yea I woll, so I woll, that I woll, I vaith la! Yea I woll, so I woll, that I woll, I vaith la!  Think you to seduce me so with words that have no meaning. Parrots can learn so to speak our voice by pieces gleaning. Nurses teach their children so about the time of weaning, nurses teach their children so about the time of weaning.  Shall a frown or angry eye, shall a word unfitly placed, shall a shadow make me fly, as I were with tigers chased? Love must not be so dis graced, love must not be so disgraced.  Truthtrying Time shall cause my mistress say, my love was perfect, content as the day: And as the day when evening doth appear, doth suffer doom to be or foul or clear, so shall my last bequest make known to all, my love in her did rise, did live, did fall. so shall my last bequest make known to all, my love in her did rise, did live, did fall.  Dear, though your mind stand so averse that no assalting words can pierce, your swift and angry flight forbear. What need you, doubt, what need you fear? In vain I strain your thoughts to move. But yet, yet, yet, yet, yet, yet stay, stay,  stay and hear me, sweet  love.  The fire to see my woes for anger burneth. The air in rain for my affliction weepeth. The sea to ebb for grief his flowing turneth. The earth with pity doth his center keepeth. Fame is with wonder blazed. Time runs away for sorrow. Place standeth still, amazed to see my night of ills which hath no morrow. Alas, all only she no pity taketh, to know my miseries. But, chaste and cruel, my fall her glory maketh. Yet still her eyes give to my flames their fuel.  When I was born, Lucina crosslegged sat. The angry stars with ominous aspects frown'd on my birth, and the foredooming Fate ordain'd to brand me with their dire effects. The sun did hide his face and left the night to bring me to this world's accursed light. The sun did hide his face and left the night to bring me to this world's accursed light.

Coy Daphne fled from Phoebus hot pursuit, careless of passion, senseless of remorse. Whilst he complain'd his grief, she rested mute. He begg'd her stay; she still kept on her course. But what reward she had for this, you see: she rest transform'd, a winterbeaten tree, she rests transform'd, she rests transform'd, she rests transform'd, a winterbeaten tree.  Thou pretty bird, how do I see thy silly state and mine agree. For thou a prisoner art; so is my heart. Thou sing'st to her and so do I address my music to her ear, that's merciless. But herein doth, herein doth the difference lie: that thou art grac'd, so am not I. Thou, singing, liv'st, singing, singing, singing, liv'st, and I must, singing, die, but herein doth, herein doth the difference lie: that thou art grac'd, so am not I.

Like as the lute delights, delights or else, or else dislikes as is his art that plays upon the same, so  sounds    my muse, so sounds my Muse; it sounds according as she strikes on my heart strings,     high tuned, high tuned unto her fame. Her touch doth cause the warble of the sound which here I yield in lamentable wise, in lamentable wise, in lamentable wise, lamentable wise, A wailing descant, a wailing descant on the sweetest ground, whose   due reports, whose   due reports gives honour to her eyes, whose   due reports, whose   due reports  gives honour to her eyes. If any pleasing relish here I use, judge then the world: her beauty gives the same. Else harsh my style, untuneable my Muse; hoarse sounds the voice   that praiseth not her name. For noground else, for no ground else could    make the music such, Nor other hand could  give so sweet a touch, could give so sweet a touch, for noground else, for no ground else could    make the music such, Nor other hand could  give so sweet a touch, could give so sweet a touch.  Dost, dost thou withdraw thy grace, dost, O dost thou withdraw thy grace because I should not love, and think'st thou to remove my affections with thy face? As if that love did hold no part, but where thy beauty lies, and were not in my heart greater than in thy fair eyes.  if that love did hold no part, but where thy beauty lies, and were not in my heart greater than than where it shines!

Arm not thy graces to confound;  only look, only look, only look but do not wound, only look but do not wound,  only look, only look, only look, only look, but do not wound,  only look, but do not wound.  Stay, cruel, stay. Pity mine anguish. And if I languish for that which you do bear away, Ah, how can you be so unkind as not to grieve for that you leave behind? And if you'll go, and if you'll go, yet let your pity stay, yet let your pity stay, and if you will go, and if you will go, yet let your pity stay, yet O let your pity stay. But will you go? Say, will you? O will you go and show that you neglect, that you neglect me? Yet say farewell, yet say farewell, yet say farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell, yet say farewell and seem but to respect, O seem but to respect me, yet say farewell, yet say farewell, yet say farewell, farewell, farewell, farewell, yet say farewell and seem but to respect, O seem but to respect me.  Time, cruel Time, canst thou subdue that brow that conquers all but thee and thee too stays, as if she were, as if she were exempt from scythe or bow, from  love and years unsubject to decay? Time, cruel Time, canst thou subdue that brow that conquers all but thee and thee too stays, as if she were, as if she were exempt from scythe or bow, from  love and years unsubject to decay?

Joys, delights,   and pleasures in us hold   such a doubtful part, as if they   were but thrall, and those were all in all. For    griefs, distrusts, re-  morse, I see must domineer the heart.

I die whenas I do not see her that is life and all to me, and when I see her, yet I die in seeing of her cruelty, so that to me like misery is wrought both when I see  her, both when I see and when I see her not, so that to me like misery is wrought both when I see  her, both when I see and when I see her not.

Unquiet thoughts, your civil slaughter stint, And wrap your wrongs within a pensive heart: And you: my tongue that makes my mouth a mint, And stamps my thoughts to coin them words by art, Be still: for if you ever do the like I'll cut the string, I'll cut the string that makes the hammer strike. Be still: for if you ever do the like I'll cut the string, I'll cut the string that makes the hammer strike.  Who ever thinks or hopes of love for love: Or who belov'd in Cupid's laws doth glory: Who joys in vows, or vows not to remove: Who by this lightgod hath not been made sorry: Let him see me eclipsed from my sun, With dark clouds of an earth, with dark clouds of an earth quite overrun. Let him see me eclipsed from my sun, With dark clouds of an earth, with dark clouds of an earth quite overrun.  My thoughts are wing'd with hopes, my hopes with love. Mount Love unto the moon in clearest night And say, as she doth in the heavens move, In earth so wanes and waxeth my delight: And whisper this but softly in her ears, Hope oft doth hang the head, and Trust shed tears. And whisper this but softly in her ears, Hope oft doth hang the head, and Trust shed tears.  If my complaints could passions move, Or make Love see wherein I suffer wrong, My passions were enough to prove That my despairs had govern'd me too long. O Love, I live and die in thee; Thy grief in my deep sighs still speaks; Thy     wounds do freshly bleed in me; My heart for thy unkindness breaks. Yet thou dost hope when I despair, And when I hope thou mak'st me hope in vain. Thou say'st thou canst my harms repair, Yet for redress thou let'st me still complain.

Can she excuse my wrongs with virtue's cloak? Shall I call her good when she proves unkind? Are those clear fires which vanish into smoke? Must I praise the leaves where no fruit I find? No, no: where shadows do for bodies stand Thou may'st be abus'd if thy sight be dim. Cold love is like to words written on sand, Or to bubbles which on the water swim. Wilt thou be thus abused still, seeing that she will right thee never? If thou canst not o'ercome her will, Thy love will be thus fruitless ever. Wilt thou be thus abused still, seeing that she will right thee never? If thou canst not o'ercome her will, Thy love will be thus fruitless ever.  Now, O now I needs must part, Parting though I absent mourn. Absence can no joy impart: Joy once fled can not return. While I live I needs must love, Love lives not when Hope is gone. Now at last Despair doth prove, Love divided loveth none.                                                              Dear, if you change, I'll never choose again. Sweet, if you shrink, I'll never think of love. Fair, if you fall, I'll judge all beauty vain. Wise, if too weak, moe wits I'll never prove. Dear, Sweet, Fair, Wise, change, shrink, nor be not weak: And, on my faith, my faith shall never break, Dear, Sweet, Fair, Wise, change, shrink, nor be not weak: And, on my faith, my faith shall never break.  Burst, burst forth my tears, assist my forward grief, And show what pain imperious Love provokes. Kind tender lambs, lament Love's scant relief, And pine, since pensive Care my freedom yokes. O pine, to see me pine, O pine, to see me pine, my tender flocks. O pine, to see me pine, O pine, to see me pine, my tender flocks.  Go, crystal tears, like to the morning show'rs, And sweetly weep into my lady's breast. And as the dews revive the drooping flow'rs, So let your drops of pity be address'd, To quicken up the thoughts of my desert, Which sleeps too sound whilst I from her depart, To quicken up the thoughts of my desert, Which sleeps too sound whilst I from her depart.  Think'st thou then by thy feigning Sleep, with a proud disdaining, Or with thy crafty closing Thy cruel eyes reposing, To drive me from thy sight, When sleep yields more delight, Such harmless beauty gracing. And while sleep feigned is, May not I steal a kiss, Thy quiet arms embracing?  Come away, come, sweet love! The golden morning breaks; All the earth, all the air of love and pleasure speaks. Teach thine arms then to embrace, And sweet Rosy Lips to kiss, And mix our souls in mutual bliss. Eyes were made for beauty's grace, Viewing, Rueing Lovelong pain Procured by beauty's rude disdain.

Eyes were made for beauty's grace, Viewing, Rueing Lovelong pain Procured by beauty's rude disdain. rude disdain.  Rest awhile, you cruel cares, Be not more severe than love. Beauty kills and beauty spares, And sweet smiles sad sighs remove: Laura, fair queen of my delight, Come grant me love in love's despite, And if I ever fail to honor thee,                                    Sleep wayward thoughts, and rest you with my love; Let not my Love be with my love displeased. Touch not, proud hands, lest you her anger move, But pine you with my longings long diseased. Thus while she sleeps I sorrow for her sake.                     Thus while she sleeps I sorrow for her sake.                      All ye, whom Love or Fortune hath betray'd; All ye, that dream of bliss but live in grief; All ye, whose hopes are evermore delay'd; All ye, whose sighs, whose sighs or sickness wants relief; Lend ears and tears to me, most hapless man, That sings my sorrows, that sings my sorrows like the dying swan. Lend ears and tears to me, most hapless man, That sings my sorrows, that sings my sorrows like the dying swan.  Wilt thou unkind thus reave me of my heart, of my heart, and so leave me, and so leave me, Wilt thou unkind thus reave me of my heart, of my heart, and so leave me, and so leave me?                                                Would my conceit, that first enforc'd my woe, Or else mine eyes which still the same increase, Might be extinct, to end my sorrows so, Which now are such as nothing can release: Whose life is death, whose sweet each change of sour, And eke whose hell reneweth ev'ry hour. Whose life is death, whose sweet each change of sour, And eke whose hell reneweth ev'ry hour.  Come again!

His golden locks Time hath to silver turn'd. O Time too swift, O swiftness never ceasing! His youth 'gainst Time and Age hath ever spurn'd, But spurn'd in vain; youth waneth by increasing. Beauty, strength, youth are flow'rs but fading seen: Duty, faith, love are roots and ever green. Beauty, strength, youth are flow'rs but fading seen: Duty, faith, love are roots and ever green.  Awake,  sweet love, thou art returned My heart,  which long in absence mourned, Lives now in perfect joy. Let love, which never absent dies, Now live forever in her eyes, whence came my first annoy. Only her self hath seemed fair, She, only I could love, She only drove me to despair When she unkind did prove. Despair did make me wish to die, That I my joys might end. She only, which did make me fly, My state may now amend.  Come, heavy sleep, the image of true death; And close up these my weary weeping eyes: whose spring of tears doth stop my vital breath, and tears my heart with sorrow's sighswoll'n cries: Come, and possess my tired thoughtsworn  soul, that living dies, that living dies, that living dies till thou on me be stole. Come, and possess my tired thoughtsworn  soul, that living dies, that living dies, that living dies till thou on me be stole.  Away with these selfloving lads, Whom Cupid's arrow never glads. Away, poor souls, that sigh and weep. In love of them that lie and sleep. For Cupid is a meadow God, And forceth none to kiss the rod. For Cupid is a meadow God, And forceth none to kiss the rod.  I saw my   lady weep And sorrow proud to be advanced so In those fair eyes, in those fair eyes where all perfections keep. Her face was full of woe, full of woe; But such a woe, believe me, as wins more hearts Than mirth can do with her, with her enticing parts  Flow my tears, fall from your springs! Exiled forever let me mourn; Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings, There let me live forlorn. Flow my tears, fall from your springs! Exiled forever let me mourn; Where night's black bird her sad infamy sings, There let me live forlorn. Never may my woes be relieved, since pity is fled; And tears and sighs and groans my weary days, my weary days Of all joys have deprived. Never may my woes be relieved, since pity is fled; And tears and sighs and groans my weary days, my weary days Of all joys have deprived.

Die not before thy day, poor, poor man condemned, But lift thy low looks, but lift thy low looks from the humble earth. Kiss not despair and see sweet Hope contemned. The hag hath no delight but moan, but moan for mirth. O fie poor foundling, O fie poor foundling! Fie! Fie! be willing to preserve thyself from killing. Hope, thy keeper, glad to free thee, Bids thee go and will not see thee. Hie thee quickly from thy wrong! So she ends her willing song.  Mourn! Mourn! Day is with darkness fled. What heav'n then governs earth? O none but hell in heaven's stead Chokes with his mists our mirth. Mourn! Mourn! Look now for no more day nor night, but that from hell.

Praise blindness, eyes, for seeing is deceit. Be dumb, vain tongue; words are but flatt'ring winds. Break, heart, and bleed, for there is no receipt To purge inconstancy from most men's minds.                                              From fame's desire, from love's delight retired, In these sad groves an hermit's life I led; And those false pleasures which I once admir'd, With sad remembrance of my fall, my fall I dread. To birds, to trees, to earth impart I this, For she less secret and as senseless is. To birds, to trees, to earth impart I this, For she less secret and as senseless is.  If floods of tears could cleanse my follies past, And smokes of sighs might sacrifice for sin; If groaning cries might salve my fault at last, Or endless moan for error pardon win, Then would I cry, weep, sigh, and ever moan, Mine errors, faults, sins, follies, past and gone. Then would I cry, weep, sigh, and ever moan, Mine errors, faults, sins, follies, past and gone.  Fine knacks for ladies, cheap, choice, brave and new! Good pennyworths! But money cannot move. I keep a fair but for the fair to view; A beggar may be liberal of love. Though all my wares be trash, the heart is true, the heart is true, the heart is true. Though all my wares be trash, the heart is true, the heart is true, the heart is true.  Now cease, my wand'ring eyes, Strange beauties to admire. In change least comfort lies; Long joys yield long desire. One faith, one love Makes our frail pleasures eternal, and in sweetness prove New hopes, new joys Are still with sorrow declining unto deep annoys.  Come, ye heavy states of night, Do my father's spirit right. Soundings baleful let me borrow, Burthening my song with sorrow. Come, sorrow, come; her eyes that sings By thee are turned into springs. Come, sorrow, come; her eyes that sings By thee are turned into springs.

A shepherd in a shade his plaining made, Of love and lovers' wrong, Unto the fairest lass that trod on grass, And thus began his song: A shepherd in a shade his plaining made, Of love and lovers' wrong, Unto the fairest lass that trod on grass, And thus began his song: Restore, restore my heart again, Which love by thy sweet looks hath slain, Lest that, enforc'd by your disdain, I sing:                 Lest that, enforc'd by your disdain, I sing:                  Faction that ever dwells, In court where wits excels, Hath let defiance. Fortune and love hath sworne That they were never born Of one alliance. Fortune and love hath sworne That they were never born Of one alliance.  Shall I sue, shall I seek for grace? Shall I pray, shall I prove? Shall I strive to a heav'nly grace with an earthly love? Shall I think that a bleeding heart Or a wounded eye, Or a sigh can ascend the clouds to attain so high? Shall I think that a bleeding heart Or a wounded eye, Or a sigh can ascend the clouds to attain so high?  Toss not my soul, O love, twixt hope and fear; Show me some ground where I may firmly stand Or surely fall; I care not which appear, So one will close me in a certain band. When once of ill the uttermost is known, The strength of sorrow quite is overthrown. When once of ill the uttermost is known, The strength of sorrow quite is overthrown.  Clear or cloudy, sweet as April show'ring, Smooth or frowning, so is her face to me. Pleas'd or smiling like mild May all flow'ring, When skies blue silk and meadows carpets be, Her speeches notes of that night bird that singeth, Who thought all sweet yet jarring notes outringeth. Her speeches notes of that night bird that singeth, Who thought all sweet yet jarring notes outringeth.  Humour, say what mak'st thou here In the presence of a queen? Princes hold conceit most dear, All conceit in humour seen. Thou art a heavy leaden mood. Humour is invention's food.                                Farewell, too fair, too chaste, but too, too cruel; Discretion never quenched fire with swords. Why hast thou made my heart thine anger's fuel, And now would kill my passions with thy words? This is proud beauty's true anatomy: If that secure, severe in secrecy. Farewell, farewell.  Time stands still with gazing on her  face. Stand still and gaze, for minutes, hours, and years to her give place. All other things shall change, but she remains the same Till heavens changed have their course and time hath lost his name. Cupid doth hover up and down, blinded with her fair eyes, And Fortune, captive at her feet, contemn'd and conquer'd lies. Cupid doth hover up and down, blinded with her fair eyes, And Fortune, captive at her feet, contemn'd and conquer'd lies.  Behold a wonder here: Love hath receiv'd his sight, Which many hundred, hundred, hundred years Hath not beheld the light. Which many hundred, hundred, hundred years Hath not beheld the light.  Daphne was not so chaste as she was changing, Soon begun love with hate estranging. He that today triumphs with favours graced, Falls before night with scorns defaced. Yet is thy beauty feign'd, and ev'ryone desires Still the false light, the false light of thy trait'rous fires. Yet is thy beauty feign'd, and ev'ryone desires Still the false light, the false light of thy trait'rous fires.  Me, me, and none but me, dart home, O gentle Death, And quickly, for I draw too long this idle breath. O how I long till I may fly to heav'n above Unto my faithful, unto my faithful and beloved turtle dove. O how I long till I may fly to heav'n above Unto my faithful, unto my faithful and beloved turtle dove.  When Phoebus first did Daphne love And no means might her favour move, He crav'd the cause; The cause, quoth she, Is I have vow'd virginity. Then in a rage he sware and said: Past fifteen none, none but one should live a maid. Then in a rage he sware and said: Past fifteen none, none but one should live a maid.  Say, Love, if ever thou didst find A woman with a constant mind? None but one. And what should that rare mirror be? Some goddess or some queen is she? She, she, she, she, she, she, and only she, She only queen of love and beauty. But Love, if ever thou didst find A woman with a constant mind? None but one. And what should that rare mirror be?

Swell not above your mountains, Nor spend your time in waste.                                                            What if I never speed? Shall I straight   yield to despair, And still on sorrow feed That can no loss repair? Or shall I change my love? For I find pow'r to depart, And in my reason prove I can command my heart. But if she will pity my desire and my love requite, Then ever shall she live my dear delight. Come, come, come, while I have a heart to desire thee, Come, come, come, for either I will love or admire thee. But if she will pity my desire and my love requite, Then ever shall she live my dear delight. Come, come, come, while I have a heart to desire thee, Come, come, come, for either I will love or admire thee.  What if I never speed?

Come, come, come, while I have a heart to desire thee, Come, come, come, for either I will love or admire thee.  Love stood amazed at sweet Beauty's pain: Love would have said that all was but vain, And gods but half divine. But when Love saw that Beauty would die, He, all aghast, to heavens did cry: O gods, O gods, what wrong is mine! But when Love saw that Beauty would die, He, all aghast, to heavens did cry: O gods, O gods, what wrong is mine!  Lend your ears to my sorrow, Good people that have any pity; For no eyes will I borrow, Mine own shall grace my doleful ditty. Chant it, my voice, though rude like to my rhyming, And tell forth my grief, which here in sad despair Can find no ease of tormenting.  By a fountain where I lay, All blessed be that blessed day! By the glim'ring of the sun, O never be her shining done! When I might see alone My true love's fairest one, Love's dear light, Love's clear sight, No world's eyes can clearer see, A fairer sight none, none can be. When I might see alone My true love's fairest one, Love's dear light, Love's clear sight, No world's eyes can clearer see, A fairer sight none, none can be.  O what hath overwrought My allamazed thought? Or whereto am I brought That thus in vain have sought Till time and truth hath taught I labour all for nought? The day I see is clear, But I am n'er the near, For grief doth still appear To cross our merry cheer, While I can nothing hear But winter all the year. Cold, hold! The sun will shine warm, Therefore now fear no harm. O blessed beams Where beauty streams Happy, happy light to love's dreams. O blessed beams Where beauty streams Happy, happy light to love's dreams.  Farewell, unkind, farewell! To me no more a father, Since my heart, my heart holds my love most dear. The wealth which thou dost reap annother's hand must gather, Though my heart, my heart still lies buried there. Then farewell, then farewell, O farewell! Welcome, my love! Welcome my joy for ever! Then farewell, then farewell, O farewell! Welcome, my love! Welcome my joy for ever!  Weep you no more, sad fountains; What need you flow so fast? Look how the snowy mountains Heav'ns sun doth gently waste But my sun's heav'nly eyes View not your weeping That now lies sleeping, that now lies sleeping, Softly, softly, now softly lies sleeping. But my sun's heav'nly eyes View not your weeping That now lies sleeping, that now lies sleeping, Softly, softly, now softly lies sleeping.  Weep you no more, sad fountains; What need you flow so fast? Look how the snowy mountains Heav'ns sun doth gently waste.

But my sun's heav'nly eyes View not your weeping That now lies sleeping, that now lies sleeping, Softly, softly, now softly lies sleeping.  Fie on this feigning! Is love without desire, Heat still remaining, And yet no spark of fire? Thou art untrue, nor wert with fancy moved, For desire hath pow'r on all that ever loved. Thou art untrue, nor wert with fancy moved, For desire hath pow'r on all that ever loved.  I must complain, yet do enjoy, enjoy my love; She is too fair, too rich in beauty's parts. Thence is my grief: for Nature, while she strove With all her graces and divinest arts To form her too, too beauti ful of hue, She had no leisure, she had no leisure, no leisure left to make her true. She had no leisure, she had no leisure, no leisure left to make her true.  It was a time when silly bees could speak; And in that time, I was a silly bee Who fed on thyme until my heart 'gan break, Yet never found the time would favour me. Of all the swarm I only did not thrive, Yet brought I wax and honey to the hive. Of all the swarm I only did not thrive, Yet brought I wax and honey to the hive.  The lowest trees have tops, the ant her gall, The fly her speen, the little spark his heat; And slender hairs cast shadows though but small, And bees have stings, although they be not great; Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs, And love is love in beggars and in kings. Seas have their source, and so have shallow springs, And love is love in beggars and in kings.  What poor astronomers are they Take women's eyes for stars, And set their thoughts in battle ray To fight such idle wars; When in the end they shall approve, 'Tis but a jest drawn out of love. When in the end they shall approve, 'Tis but a jest drawn out of love.  Come   when I call, or tarry till I come; If you be deaf, I must   prove dumb.   Stay awhile, my   heav'nly joy, I come with wings of love,  When   envious eyes Time shall remove.   If thy desire ever knew the grief of delay, No danger could stand in thy way.  O do not add this sorrow to my grief that languish   here,   wanting relief. What  need we languish? Can Love quick-   ly, quickly fly? Fear ever hurts  more than jealousy.

Disdain me still, that I may ever love, For who his Love enjoys can love, can love no more. The war once past, with ease men cowards prove: And ships return'd do rot upon the shore. And though thou frown, I'll say thou art most fair, most fair: And still I'll love and still I'll love, I'll love, though still, though still I must despair.

The light you see comes from your eyes; The day breaks not, it is my heart, To think that you and I must part. O stay! Oh stay! or else my joys, my joys, my joys must die And perish in their infancy. O stay! Oh stay! or else my joys, my joys, my joys must die And perish in their infancy.  To ask for all thy love, and thy whole heart,  'Twere madness. I do not sue, Nor can admit (Fairest) from you To have all, yet Who giveth all hath nothing to impart, But sadness. I do not sue, Nor can admit (Fairest) from you To have all, yet Who giveth all hath nothing to impart, But sadness.  Love those beams that breed, All day long Breed and feed, This burning Love I quench with floods, Floods of tears, Nightly tears and mourning. But, alas, tears cool this fire in vain, in vain, The more I quench, the more I quench, the more there doth remain.  To ask for all thy love, and thy whole heart,  'Twere madness. I do not sue, Nor can adTo ask for all thy love, and thy whole heart,  'Twere madness. I do not sue, Nor can admit (Fairest) from you To have all, yet Who giveth all hath nothing to impart, But sadness.  Shall I strive with words to move, When deeds receive not due regard? Shall I speak, and neither please, nor be freely heard? Grief, alas though all in vain, Her restless anguish must reveal: She alone my wound shall know though she will not heal. All woes have end, though awhile delay'd, Our patience proving. O that Time's strange effects could but make, but make her loving. Storms calm at last, and why may not she Leave off her frowning? O sweet Love, help her hands My affections, my affections crowning. I woo'd her, I lov'd her, and none but her admire. O come dear joy, and answer my desire. I woo'd her, I lov'd her, and none but her admire. O come dear joy, and answer my desire.  Were every thought an eye, And all those eyes could see, Her subtle wiles their sights would beguile, And mock their jealousy. Her fires do inward burn; They make no outward show. And her delights amid the dark shades, which none discover, grow. Desire lives in her heart Diana in her eyes. 'Twere vain to wish women true; 'tis well If they prove wise. The flower's growth is unseen, Yet ev'ry day it grows. So where her fancy is set, it thrives, But how none knows. Such a love deserves more grace Than a truer heart that hath no conceit, To make use of both time and place, When a wit hath need of all his sleight. Such a love deserves more grace Than a truer heart that hath no conceit, To make use of both time and place, When a wit hath need of all his sleight.  Stay, Time, awhile thy flying; Stay and pity me dying. For Fates and friends have left me And of comfort bereft me. Come, come, come mine eyes; better to die blessed Than to live, than to live thus distressed.  Tell me, true love, where shall I seek thy being, In thoughts or words, in vows or promise making, In reasons, looks, or passions, or passions never seeing, In men on earth, or women's minds partaking? Thou canst not die, and therefore, living, therefore, living, tell me: Where is thy seat, is thy seat, thy seat; why, why doth this age expel thee? Thou canst not die, and therefore, living, therefore, living, tell me: Where is thy seat, is thy seat, thy seat; why, why doth this age expel thee?  Go, nightly cares, go, nightly cares, the enemy to rest; Forbear, forbear awhile to vex my grieving sprite. So long, so long your weight, so long, so long your weight hath lain upon my breast, That lo I live, that lo I live, that lo I live of life bereaved quite. O give me time to draw my weary breath, Or let me die, as I desire the death. Welcome, sweet death, welcome, sweet death, welcome, sweet death, sweet death, welcome, O life, no life, a hell, Then thus, and thus I bid the world farewell.  From silent night, true register of moans, -  From saddest soul   consum'd with deepest sins, From heart quite rent with sighs, with sighs and heavy groans, My wailing Muse her woe, her woe, her woeful work begins. And to the world brings tunes of sad despair, and to the world brings tunes of sad despair, Sounding nought else but sorrow, sorrow, nought else, nought else but sorrow, nought else but sorrow, grief and care, and to the world brings tunes of sad despair, Sounding nought else but sorrow, sorrow, nought else, nought else but sorrow, nought else but sorrow, grief and care.  If that a sinner's sighs be Angels' food, Or that repentant tears be Angels' wine, Accept, O Lord, in this most pensive mood These hearty sighs and doleful plaints of mine That went, like Peter, forth most sinfully, But not, as Peter did, weep, weep, weep, weep bitterly. That went, like Peter, forth most sinfully, But not, as Peter did, weep, weep, weep, weep bitterly.  When David's life by Saul was often sought, David's life by Saul, by Saul was often sought, And worlds of woes, worlds of woes, of woes did compass, compass him about, about, On dire revenge he never, never had a thought, a thought; But in his griefs, but in his griefs, his griefs, his griefs, hope still did help him out, hope still did help him, help him out. On dire revenge he never, never had a thought, a thought; But in his griefs, but in his griefs, his griefs, his griefs, hope still did help him out, hope still did help him, help him out.

In darkness let me dwell. the ground, the ground shall sorrow, sorrow be, The roof despair to bar all, all cheerful light from me, The walls of marble black that moistened, that moistened still shall weep still, shall weep, My music, my music hellish, hellish jarring sounds, jarring, jarring sounds, to banish, banish friendly sleep. Thus wedded to my woes, And bedded to my tomb, O, let me, living die, O, let me, living, let me living, living die Till death, till death do come, till death, till death do come, till death, till death do come, In darkness let me dwell.  My heavy sprite, opprest with sorrow's might, of wearied limbs the burden sore sustains, with silent groans, with silent groans and heart's tears still complains, yet I breathe still and live in life's despight. Have I lost thee? All fortunes I accurse, bids thee farewell, with thee all joys farewell, and for thy sake this world becomes my hell, and for thy sake this world becomes my hell.

Like hermit poor, in place obscure, I mean to spend my days of endless doubt, To wail such woes as Time can not recure, Where none but Love, shall find me out; And at my gates despair shall, despair shall linger still To let in death when Love and Fortune, when Love and Fortune will.  Come home, my troubled thoughts; stay and retire; Call home your erring fellows; make a stand. Follow not still the colours of Desire; False are her wishes, cruel her command. Come then, obey this summons; come away, come away, For here vain hopes, for here vain hopes must serve you for your pay. Come then, obey this summons; come away, come away, For here vain hopes, for here vain hopes must serve you for your pay.  Come away, come away, We grow jealous of your stay.

We shall have more cause to fear Sirens of the land, than they To doubt the Sirens of the Sea.  Dear, when to thee my sad complaint I make, And show how oft love doth my death renew; And how afresh I suffer for thy sake I ever fear this answer to ensue: Who would bewail the bird that 'scapes the snare, And ever caught, and never can be ware. Who would bewail the bird that 'scapes the snare, And ever caught, and never can be ware.  Fain I would, but O I dare not, Speak my thoughts at full to praise her. Speak the best, cries Love, and spare not; Thy speech can no higher raise her. Thy speech than thy thoughts are lower, Yet thy thoughts do not half know her. Thy speech than thy thoughts are lower, Yet thy thoughts do not half know her.  Come, my Celia, let us prove, While we may, the sweets of Love. Time will not be ours for ever; He at length our good will sever. Come, my Celia, let us prove, While we may, the sweets of Love. Time will not be ours for ever; He at length our good will sever. Why should we defer our joys? Fame and Rumor are but toys. Cannot we delude the eyes Of a few poor household spies? Or his easier ears beguile Thus removed by our wile?

So, so, leave off this last lamen ting kiss        Which sucks two souls, and vapors  both away. Turn    thou ghost, that way; and let me turn this; And let ourselves be night our happy day.

Young and simple though I am, I have heard of Cupid's name. Guess I can what thing it is, Men desire when they do kiss. Smoke can never burn they say; But the flames, but the flames that follow may. Smoke can never burn they say; But the flames, but the flames that follow may.  Drown not with tears, my dearest love, Those eyes which my affections move. Do not with weeping those lights blind, Which me in thy subjection bind. Time, that hath made us two of one, And forc'd thee now to live alone, Will once again us reunite To show how she can Fortune spite. Then will we our time redeem And hold our hours in more esteem, Turning all our sweetest nights Into millions of de lights And strive with many thousand kisses To multiply, to multiply exchange of blisses, exchange of blisses. Then will we our time redeem And hold our hours in more esteem, Turning all our sweetest nights Into millions of de lights And strive with many thousand kisses To multiply, to multiply exchange of blisses, exchange of blisses.  I am a lover, yet was never lov'd; Well have I lov'd and will, though hated ever. Troubles I pass, yet never any mov'd; Sighs have I giv'n, and yet she heard me never. I would complain and she would never hear me; And fly from love, but it is ever near me. Oblivion only blameless doth beset me, For that rememb'reth never to forget me.  Why stays the bridegroom to invade her, that would be a matron made, Goodnight, whilst yet we may, goodnight to you a virgin say. Tomorrow rise, the same your mother is, and use a nobler name. Speed well in hymens war, that what you are, by your perfections we and all may see. Tomorrow rise, the same your mother is, and use a nobler name.

Sing we then heroic grace, So with lovely light adorning, that fair heaven of his face, As the Star that leads the morning; Body brave for part and whole, purest seat of purer soul, Where reposed lodge by nature, Princely strength and comely stature. Sing the riches of his skill, Long by studious toil provided, Wit that never guideth ill, Will that never ill is guided; Judgement that can best discern, Memory that needs not learn, Courage where such thoughts assemble, Justly may his haters tremble. Sing the nobles of his race; Sing his pow'r, his wealth, his glory, Breaking all the bounds of place, Endless age's ageless story. Peace that maketh one of two More than ever war could do; Terror chased, terror chased, Justice fixed, Mercy, Mercy still with Justice mixed.

With what new thoughts should I now entertain My mind, if I my sadness should forego? What pleasing hopes have I not proved, I not proved vain? Or what false shout of joy do I not know? O partial love, there is no pow'r in thee To make her love, or else to set me free, to make her love, or else to set me free. O partial love, there is no pow'r in thee To make her love, or else to set me free, to make her love, or else to set me free.

So when he parted earth from fire, He did with concord all inspire. And then a motion he them taught That elder than himself was thought; Which   thought was yet the child of earth, For Love is elder than his birth. Which   thought was yet the child of earth, For Love is elder than his birth.  Had those that dwell in error foul, And hold that women have no soul, But seen those move, they would have then Said women were the souls of men; So they do move each heart and eye With the world's soul, their harmony.

If all the ages of the earth Were crowned but with this famous birth, but with this famous birth; And when they would boast their store Of worthy queens, of worthy queens they know no more; How happier is that age can give A queen in whom they all do live. And when they would boast their store Of worthy queens, of worthy queens they know no more; How happier is that age can give A queen in whom they all do live.  Unconstant love, why should I make my moan or send sad sighs unto thy careless ear, Since thy affection and thy faith is gone, And all those virtues which I once held dear? Farewell, farewell, most false of all to me That with affection dearly, dearly loved thee. Farewell, farewell, most false of all to me That with affection dearly, dearly loved thee.  O eyes, O morttal stars, The authors of my harms, That in slumb'ring wage wars To kill me with sweet charms; If closed you annoy me, Being open, you'd destroy me, if closed you annoy me, being open, you'd destroy me, if closed you annoy me, being open, you'd destroy me, if closed you annoy me, being open you'd destroy me  How can the tree but waste and wither away, that hath not sometime comfort of the sun? How can the flow'r but fade and soon decay, that always is with dark clouds overrun?                                           The saint I serve and have besought full oft, upon my knees to stand my goddess good, with hope did hold some time my head aloft and fed my fancy fond with dainty food. But now I see that words are naught but wind:  the sweeter meat, the sourer sauce I find,  the sweeter meat, the sourer sauce I find.   Where griping grief the heart would wound, and doleful dumps the mind  oppress, there music with her silver sound is wont with speed to give redress; of troubled minds, for every sore. sweet music hath a salve in store.  Ah, ah, alas, you salt sea gods! Bow down your ears divine; lend ladies here warm water springs to moist their crystal eune. That they may weep and wail and wring their hands with me for death of lord and husband mine. Alas, alas, alas, alas! Lo: this is he! Alas, alas, alas, alas! Lo: this is he! You gods that guide the ghosts and souls of them that fled, send sobs, send sighs, send grievous groans and strike poor Panthea dead. Abradad, Abradad, ah, ah, alas poor Abradad! My sprite with thine shall lie. Come, death, alas, O death most sweet, for now, for now, for now I crave to die, to die, to die, to die, to die.  Alas, alack, my heart is woe. I pine, I waste in seas of pain. Good ladies, all your tunes bestow to mourn with him whom fates constrain. I sigh, I sob, I sink in grief. I fain would die, would die. Death, yield relief, Death, yield relief! I sigh, I sob, I sink in grief. I fain would die, would die. Death, yield re lief, Death yield relief!  Mistrust misdeems amiss, whereby displeasure grows, and time delay'd makes friends afraid their faith for to disclose. Suspect thus breedeth thought, and thought to sighs convert, and sighs have brought a flood of tears where sorrows soak the heart, suspect thus breedeth thought, and thought to sighs convert, and sighs have brought a flood of tears where sorrows soak the heart.  A doleful, deadly pang consumes my pining heart, which beauty's wounding shot renews with still increasing smart. Alas, I sigh and sob; I will go plead for life. Love's vapors that distill to tears in drowning eyes be rife. Oh pity me, I die, oh pity me, I die. I die, I die, I die, I die, I die, I die.  Come tread the paths of pensive pangs with me, ye lovers true. Bewail with me your luckless lots. With tears your eyes bedew. Aid me, you ghosts who loathed life, your lovers being slain, with sighs and sobs and notes of dole my hard hap to complain. Farewell, my lords and friends; farewell all princely state. Let father rue his rigor, shown in slaying of my mate. Guichardo! Guichardo! Ah! Guichardo, if thy sprite do walk, come draw thy lover nigh. Behold, behold, I yield to thee my ghost. Ah, see! I die, I die, I die, ah, see! I die, I die, I die Ah, ah, ah, alas, I die, I die, I die, I die.
